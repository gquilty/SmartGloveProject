 *  - @c SLEEP_IDLE.
 *  - @c SLEEP_LIGHT.
 *  - @c SLEEP_MODERATE.
 *  - @c SLEEP_DEEP.
 *  - @c SLEEP_POWERDOWN.
 *
 * These correspond to the following AVR sleep modes:
 *  - @c SLEEP_AVR_IDLE.
 *  - @c SLEEP_AVR_EXT_STANDBY.
 *  - @c SLEEP_AVR_STANDBY.
 *  - @c SLEEP_AVR_PWR_SAVE.
 *  - @c SLEEP_AVR_PWR_DOWN.

 *  - @c SLEEP_NRF_MODERATE.
