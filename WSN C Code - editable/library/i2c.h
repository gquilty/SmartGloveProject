 * I2C master implementation.
 *
 * For Atmegas, the hardware I2C unit is used, unless the 2420_revA board is
 * being used. If it is, then software bit-banging is used on the pins defined
 * as SDA and SCL in @e i2cSw_avr.h
 *
 * For nRF905, only software I2C is available. This is on the pins defined in
 * @e i2cSw_nrf.h
 *
 * I2C frequency is set by setting the @c I2C_FREQ variable. If not set, it
 * defaults to 100kHz.
 *
 * @todo Buffered I2C (interrupt based).
