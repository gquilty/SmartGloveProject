//  Revision History:
//		25 Oct 2006		Chris Sadler		Initial Release
//		10 Mar 2007		Chris Sadler		Increased WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE to
//											properly handle the case where the
//											data is very random and compression
//                                          actually causes it to expand.


/***************************************************************************//**
 * Functions for lossless compression of data. This implements the LZW algorithm
 * as described in the paper:
 * @code
 * C.M. Sadler, and M. Martonosi, 2006. Data compression algorithms for energy-
 * constrained devices in delay tolerant networks. In Proc. 4th Int. Conf.
 * Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, 265-278. doi:10.1145/1182807.1182834
 * @endcode
 *
 * There are also functions for the BWT (Burrows-Wheeler Transform), which can
 * help acheive higher compression ratios at the expense of processing time.
 *
 * Example to compress and decompress without BWT:
 * @code
 * uint8_t* rawData[100];
 * uint8_t* compressedData[100];
 * uint8_t* decompressedData[100];
 * uint16_t compressedSize;
 *
 * // Put some data into rawData array
 * compressedSize = slzw_compress(100, 16, rawData, compressedData);
 * // Delete data in rawData array
 * slzw_decompress(compressedSize, 16, compressedData, rawData);
 * // rawData is restored.
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example to compress and decompress with BWT:
 * @code
 * uint8_t* rawData[100];
 * uint8_t* bwtBuffer[102];
 * uint8_t* compressedData[100];
 * uint16_t compressedSize;
 *
 * // Put some data into rawData array
 * bwt_encode(100, rawData, bwtBuffer);
 * // Delete data in rawData array
 * compressedSize = slzw_compress(102, 16, bwtBuffer, compressedData);
 * slzw_decompress(compressedSize, 16, compressedData, bwtBuffer);
 * bwt_decode(102, bwtBuffer, rawData);
 * // rawData is restored.
 * @endcode
 *
 * Memory and processing requirements of compression, where MC is mini-cache:

 * The original code is available from http://cmsadler.googlepages.com/
 *
 * The following changes have been made:
 * - Changed FLASH_PAGE_SIZE from 264 to 256
 * - Changed MAX_DICT_ENTRIES so that it is calculated automatically based on
 *   the number of bits in dictionary index
 * - Commented out ADD_NEWEST (it had negative affects on compression ratio)
 * - Commented out STRUCTURED_TRANSFORM (not relevant for general data)
 * - Datatypes use fixed length values to avoid errors with different C
 *    compilers.
 * - Added prototypes for BWT functions
 * - Changed prototypes for slzw functions so that the data is passed in as
 *    an argument and is not required to be in a specially named extern array.
 * - Added doxygen format comments. Other comments may no longer be accurate.
