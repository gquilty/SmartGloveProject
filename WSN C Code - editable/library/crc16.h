 * Interface for CRC functions.
 *
 * Function for calculating CRC-16 checksum based on the polynomial:
 * x^16 + x^15 + x^2 + 1 (0xa001). CRC-16 is commonly used in disk-drive
 * applications.
 *
 * Example usage to calculate CRC of values in an array:
 *   @code
 *     uint16_t crcValue;
 *     crc16_init();
 *     for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
 *         crc16_update(array[i]);
 *     }
 *     crcValue = crc16_read();
 *   @endcode
 *
 * @file crc16.h
