 * Suport for application reprogramming. This reprogramming system works by
 * keeping a copy of the current application. This copy can be modified while
 * the application is still running. These modifications can be based on
 * commands recevied from UART or RF. When the modifications are complete, the
 * new code is copied over the old code, and the microcontroller is reset. The
 * actual code that does this copying, cannot be part of the application as it
 * would be corrupted by the copying. Therefore for the ATmega, this code is
 * kept in the bootloader section of memory, and cannot be modified. For the
 * nRF9E5, there is no problem, as when it powers on, it copies all the program
 * code into internal RAM, so the external EEPROM can be modified easily.
