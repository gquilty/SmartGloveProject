 * Function for reading from ad7997/8 ADC. Look at the datasheet for more.
 *
 * The ADC is read in mode 2 using the convert sequence command. The sequence of
 * channels to read is set in the configuration register. This only needs to be
 * done if the current sequence is different to the previous.
 *
 * @todo: The function below only supports a subset of the features provided by
 *     the ADC. For example it could be configured to give a signal when
 *     values go above or below a specified threshold etc.
