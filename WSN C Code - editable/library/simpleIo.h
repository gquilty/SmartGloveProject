 * memory, it is advisable to use these instead of @c printf(). If
 * @c SIMPLEIO_SMALLER is defined, then only unsigned numebrs are supported, and
 * leading 0's of numbers will be printed, i.e. decimal numbers will always have
 * five digits, and hexadecimal will have 4 digits. If @c SIMPLEIO_LOWERCASE is
 * defined then lowercase letters will be used in hexadecimal numbers.
