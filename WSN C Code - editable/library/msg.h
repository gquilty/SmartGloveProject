/***************************************************************************//**
 * Provides an interface for inter node and node-PC communication in a tree
 * network. Each node must have a unique 16 bit address. Messages can be sent
 * from any node to the gateway, where they will be transferred to the PC.
 * Messages can also be sent from the PC to any node
 *
 * When using the radio, each packet will look like this:
 * @verbatim
       <length:8><address:16><type:8><data:N>
       
           length = length of data section
           address = source (if message going to PC) or destination address
           type = see definitions below@endverbatim
 *
 * For the serial, the message will look like this:
 * @verbatim
       <STX:8><length:8><address:16><type:8><data:N><ETX:8>@endverbatim
 *
 * There are are three types of nodes. The gateway node is a 25mm node connected
 * to the PC. Nodes where @c MSG_LEAF_NODE is defined have no children. It can 
 * be a Tyndall 10mm node. Other nodes are in between and must be 25mm nodes.
 *
 * @note The @c rf_callback() and @c uart_callback() functions are
 * implemented by this library, and so cannot be implemented in an application.
 *
 * @c UART_DO_NOT_INSERT_RETURN and @c UART_USE_CALLBACK must be defined. The 
 * best place to do that is the application @e makefile.
 *
 * @todo A lot of funtionality can be implemented under this interface:
 *  - Checksum to verify message.
 *  - Packetisation to break up large messages into multiple transmissions.
 *  - ACKs.
 *  - Tranmission frequency and power.
 *  - MAC algorithms.
 *  - Dynamic tree routing.
 *  - Clustering.
