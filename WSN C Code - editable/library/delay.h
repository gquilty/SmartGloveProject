 * Functions for generating delays. Delay functions with units of microseconds,
 * milliseconds, and seconds are defined.
 *
 * For the millisecond and second delays two function types are available. The
 * first type is a blocking function. When this is called, it will not return
 * until the delay is over. The delay function will put the microcontroller into
 * a low power state to save energy.
 *
 * In the callback mode, the function will return immediately. Then, when the
 * delay period is over, the function @c delay_x_callback() will be called
 * periodically.
 *
 * To choose callback mode, the preprocessor definition @c DELAY_USE_CALLBACK_S
 * or @c DELAY_USE_CALLBACK_MS should be defined. Only one type of function can
 * be used at a time, as the same hardware timers are used.
 *
 * The blocking type function can be used to generate exact delays between some
 * events. The callback can be used when doing something with an exact period
 * or duty cycle is needed.
